# es stands for Elastic Spaces
#
# It tries to emulate Elastic Tabstops style alignment,
# with spaces instead of tabs. 
# For this it uses a simple convention:
# single spaces separate words, whereas
# multiple spaces separate cells.

# Elastic Tabstops http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/
#
# Note:
#
# this implementation is lazy.
# It relies on the fact that column -t separates cells 2 spaces by default.
# TODO: is this POSIX behaviour?
#
# It's also broken when input contains $char.
# $char is currently a very long character,
# very long meaning not monospace. 
# Given that alignment with spaces only makes sense in a monospace context,
# it's ''fine'' for now,
# for some value of fine.
